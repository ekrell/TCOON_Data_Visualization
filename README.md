Final project for Object Oriented Progamming at TAMUCC.

By myself, Javier A. Villarreal and David Neathery

Parses datasets from TCOON for a graphical display using JFreeChart.
Due to time constraints, it was built as an example of one certain combination of
data choices. However, the classes were designed in such a way as to make it easily
extansable to become a program that would handle any type of TCOON data.
May be used as an example for those learning the JFreeChart library.
I worked with many of provided funtions to customize the appearance of the graphics
in order to maintain a somewhat consistent aesthetic.bject 

I hope to use it as a base for writing some tutorials on using JFreeChart.
